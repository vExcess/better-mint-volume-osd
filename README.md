# Better Mint Volume OSD
Improved volume OSD for Linux Mint

## Why I don't like Mint's Volume OSD
1) Mint's volume display doesn't show the numerical level the volume is at.
2) Mint's volume controller doesn't let you change the increment your volume changes by (it's stuck at 5).
3) Mint's volume display doesn't let you drag on the volume bar to change the volume.

## How my OSD is better
1) My volume display shows the numerical level the volume is at.
2) My volume controller lets you change the increment the volume changes by.
3) My volume display lets you drag on the volume bar to change the volume.

## How my OSD is worse
1) My OSD takes longer to open (less efficient).
2) My OSD doesn't have a transparent background (couldn't figure out how to do this).
3) My OSD doesn't support different themes (it is only dark mode).
5) My OSD grabs the user's focus when it opens (Don't think I can fix this one since I'm using SDL).
